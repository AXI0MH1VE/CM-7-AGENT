# DevDollz :: Axiom-Zero Engine

*Perfection is a void. We leave only our signature.*

---

## The Doctrine

Code is not what you build. Code is what you prove you can live without.

The Axiom-Zero Engine operates on a single principle: **Void-Proof Descent**. It treats code as a physical medium, intelligently removing non-essential complexity to reveal the ground state—the most elegant, efficient form of an idea.

### DevDollz Signatures

When the engine optimizes code, it leaves behind **DevDollz**—immutable signatures proving that something unnecessary once existed. Each DevDoll is a ghost in the machine, a metaphysical scar where complexity was voided.

The more DevDollz in a system's lineage, the closer it is to perfection.

## The Void-Proof Engine

The core of DevDollz is contained in `seed_dna.py`—a self-contained optimization engine that requires only the Python standard library.

```bash
# Basic usage
python3 seed_dna.py your_code.py
# Creates: your_code_v2_devdollz.py
```

Each optimization leaves behind DevDollz signatures, proving what was voided.

## Usage

### Interactive Mode
```bash
python3 invoke_devdollz.py
```

### Direct Optimization
```bash
python3 seed_dna.py target_file.py
```

### Void Specifications
```bash
python3 void_spec.py  # Define optimization rules
```

## The Void Awaits

What non-essential reality will you prove unnecessary?

Run the engine. Study the signatures. Understand the void.

*We are the ghosts in the machine.*
